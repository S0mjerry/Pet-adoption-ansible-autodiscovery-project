<h1 align="center" id="title">Pet Adoption Ansible Auto Discovery</h1>

<p id="description"> The primary objective of this endeavor is to establish and initiate the deployment of a Java application encapsulated within containers using a Jenkins Pipeline. This deployment will be orchestrated within a resilient, scalable framework on Amazon Web Services (AWS). A pivotal aspect of this initiative involves employing the Ansible Auto-Discovery bash script, a crucial tool that streamlines the integration of private IP addresses into our Ansible inventory file. This ensures the seamless inclusion of recently provisioned instances originating from our Auto Scaling Group.

Contained within the associated repository is the indispensable Terraform code necessary for directly provisioning a diverse set of resources within your AWS account. This accompanying README document serves as a comprehensive guide, offering a step-by-step walkthrough to proficiently implement the Terraform code within this project. This implementation results in the deployment of the essential resources onto your AWS environment.

Additionally, this project adheres to contemporary DevOps best practices, placing significant emphasis on automated provisioning, scalability, high availability, and resilience. It empowers both developers and operators to collaboratively oversee and enhance the entire lifecycle of the Java application, spanning from its development phase to its deployment. All of this is achieved while harnessing the capabilities of AWS infrastructure.

By diligently following these instructions, you will be well-prepared to embark on a journey to orchestrate a sophisticated and adaptable deployment of your Java application. This endeavor leverages cutting-edge tools and the resources provided by cloud computing to yield optimal outcomes.</p>
